# Introduction & Explanation

[Good Program](https://goodprogram.com.au/) is a Web Design and Development Business located in Sydney. Specializing in custom web development and hi-performance web technologies that help clients get an edge on their competition.

This is the source code for the Good Program website with some sensitive omissions. It is built by incorporating:
- React/Next.js
- Sass for styling (leveraging the BEM method for extremely readable code)
- Docker and git-enabled deployment through our internal systems.

Note the use of dynamic elements and the newly integrated image element that enable the site to have an extremely low latency.

See below the Google Lighthouse Results:

While there could be an increase in the performance score, I've found that some of the indicators don't always translate to real-world performance.
